Quanage for Android is a mobile app for the application of Quantum Encryption on the Android platform.
Here we establish two randomly generated keys and keep a track of them leveraging a quantum computer provided
by cloud using their APIs. The app is a live demonstration of the QKD concepts and tends out to be the first
ever truly secure application for exchange of data across the internet.
